# MCIS-Bathroom-Status

This application is designed to ease the pain of walking to the bathroom only to find out all of the stalls are full. We have come up with an idea to create a website that will allow you to view the current status of the bathroom stalls via a sensor on the door. These sensors are connected to a Raspberry Pi (micro-computer), which hosts the website you are able to see to check the bathroom status.
